# This scanner will take a string of raw input from a user and return a sentence
# that's composed of a list of tuples with the (TOKEN, WORD) pairings.
# If a word isn't part of the lexicon then it should still return the WORD but
# set the TOKEN to an error token. These error tokens will tell users they messed up.


# take an input (function 'scan') and break it up

def lexicon():
    pass

# check if a number

# check the words for type against a list of tuples (TYPE, WORD)

# types: directions, verbs, stops, nouns, numbers, errors (6 types)

# make a sentence from the words
